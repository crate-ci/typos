For the Doctor Watsons of this world, as opposed to the Sherlock
Holmeses, success in the province of detective work must always

can extract a clew from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash;
but Doctor Watson has to have it taken out for him and dusted,
and exhibited clearly, with a label attached.\
